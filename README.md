fs = 48e3;

dt = 1/fs;

pw = 50e-3;

bw = 12e3;

slope = bw/pw;

t = [dt:dt:pw];

t = t - pw/2;


x1 = pi * slope * t.^2  +  2 *pi *1e3 *t;

x2 = pi * slope * t.^2  -  2 *pi* 1e3* t;



bit1 = exp(1i*x1);

bit0 = exp(1i*x2);


samples per symbol = 2400

number of char:  19

each char is 8 bits

number of bits:  152 bits

first 8 bits:   01000001 ,   or char A

signal is under noise

to decode signal,
multiply symbol by  exp(-1i*pi*slope*t.^2) 
then fft the product, to detect tone:    -1khz or 1khz
